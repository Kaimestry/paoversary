                        <p>The Paos Corp originally was based off of Ann - who is the Paos's mama.
                            Mama's persona looked something like a stickman with shorthair, glasses
                            , some red horns and the smile of devil. This persona was the foundation
                            of how the Paos Corp came to life.

                            Then later on, Mommy Euri made futher sketches of this persona but with a

                            Mommy Euri also loved eating Siopao back then, but she
                             also loves Ann. In order to hide her howniness of wanting
                             to eat Ann, she "put Ann inside Siopao" so it doesn't look 
                             kinky (but it is kinky if you think about it)

                            Mommy Euri then finally made some crochet of the Pao,
                            making a random rice bun, adding glasses and horn and some how
                            it looks like Ann. Mommy Euri and Mama Ann both love the crochet so 
                            much that they decided to adopt it, naming it Pao. But they didn't know that 
                            'Pao' would also bring someone else along too...

                            One quiet afternoon, Mama Euri left little Pao to 
                            play alone in the warmth of the kitchen. The flames in the hearth danced 
                            and crackled, and as Pao peered into them, something strange caught his eye.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            There, within the fire was a figure that looked like him. But it wasn't 'him'. 
                            This reflection was no pale, innocent Pao; it was a dark, grinning shadow wearing his shape.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            “Brother,” the dark Pao called softly from the heart of the fire. “I need your help.”
                            Without a thought, Pao stretched out his hand toward the flames, wanting only to save the poor creature that bore his face.
                            “Thank you, brother,” the shadow murmured as their fingers touched.
                            Neither of them knew it then, but from that single moment, a bond was forged that would outlast eternity.
