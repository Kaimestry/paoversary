            Hi, uhhhhhhhhh.... I hope you are not tired of me writing letter 
            over and over again haha.
        </p>
        <p>
            I would be happy if you read this letter <span class="highlight_yellow">after</span>
            you already explored Paoversary. Just so you know.. This is not my best effort
            on making website yet. I really wished I had enough time to make you a better gift web.
            I had a lot of failed attempt before (with more feature than just reading). But i really 
            still tried to give you something that is considered very decent to my standard.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyway... <span class="highlight_yellow">HAPPY ANNIVERSARY BABYYYY</span>, I hope you liked spending
            half of 2024 and half of 2025 with meee.

            spending more with you in the next year. I hoped you feel loved too. I hope you know that
